##Background

In the 1930s, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), a New Deal initiative, assessed neighborhoods for real estate investment safety. The HOLC’s grading system (A for green, B for blue, C for yellow, and D for red) was then used to deny loans for home ownership, a discriminatory practice known as “redlining.” This historical injustice has affected community wealth and health. Redlined areas exhibit lower greenery levels and higher temperatures compared to other neighborhoods.
I want to examine how this is still a current-day issue by outlining the socioeconomics of current tracts. A recent study found that redlining has not only affected the environments communities are exposed to, it has also shaped our observations of biodiversity.Ellis-Soto and co-authors found that redlined neighborhoods remain the most undersampled areas across 195 US cities. This gap is highly concerning, because conservation decisions are made based on these data.
